# 📝 Blog Generator using Amazon Bedrock and AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway

This project is a Python-based AWS Lambda function that called from AWS API Gateway:
- Takes a blog topic as input
- Uses Amazon Bedrock's LLaMA 4 model to generate a blog post
- Uploads the generated blog content to an Amazon S3 bucket

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✨ AI-generated blog content using `meta.llama4-scout-17b-instruct-v1:0` via Amazon Bedrock
- ☁️ Serverless execution using AWS Lambda
- 📂 Automatically uploads blog posts to S3 with a timestamped filename

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Deploy the Lambda Function
Upload the `lambda_function.py` file to AWS Lambda with appropriate IAM roles:
- Access to Amazon Bedrock
- Write access to Amazon S3

### 2. Sample Event Input
```json
{
  "body": "{\"blogTopic\": \"The Future of Renewable Energy\"}"
}
````

### 3. Output

* A generated blog is saved to your specified S3 bucket in the `blogs/` folder.
* Filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS.txt`

## 📦 Requirements

This code assumes the AWS Lambda environment or a similar setup with the following Python packages:

* `boto3`
* `botocore`
* `json`
* `datetime`

You can test it locally by setting AWS credentials in your environment and installing dependencies via pip.

---

## 🛡 IAM Permissions Required

* `bedrock:InvokeModel`
* `s3:PutObject`

Example IAM policy snippet:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "bedrock:InvokeModel",
    "s3:PutObject"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

---

## 📌 Configuration

Update the following in the code as needed:

* `modelId`: Bedrock model ID (default is LLaMA 4 instruct)
* `region_name`: AWS Region (default: `us-east-1`)
* `s3_bucket`: S3 bucket name (default: `bedrockknaagent`)
